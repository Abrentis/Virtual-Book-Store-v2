# Book Store App
## Description
Our motivation behind creating this app was to get review articles for books from a author who is new to the user, so that they can have some idea before buying the book. This simple app provides the user with two text boxes, one for author and other for ISBN code. The application will take author's name as input and with the help of NYTimes book's API will give the details (Book Title, NY Review Link, ISBN) of maximun 3 books from that author. User can click on the NY article link to read about that book/artical. Similarly, ISBN code can be used to get information about a particular book along with cover page of that book, if available. 
Local Storgage is being provided to get the information about recently searched ISBN code along with their book name. The design of this application is responsive as well.
